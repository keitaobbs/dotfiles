# Business Framework

## Derive KBFs/KSFs

KSFs are the critical elements a business must excel at to succeed in a
given industry or market.

### 1. Conduct Five Forces Analysis

You can understand the competitive dynamics and pressure points in the
industry with 5F analysis. It helps determine the external factors that
will influence success; forms the foundation for strategic alignment.

```
                     +-----------+
                     | Threat of |
                     | New Entry |
                     +-----------+
                           |
                           v
+----------+    +----------------------+    +-------+
| Supplier | -> |    Rivalry among     | <- | Buyer |
|  Power   |    | Existing Competitors |    | Power |
+----------+    +----------------------+    +-------+
                           ^
                           |
                    +--------------+
                    | Threat of    |
                    | Substitution |
                    +--------------+
```

### 2. Identify KBFs

KBFs are the critical elements that influence a customer's decision to
purchase a product or service.

| Segmentation/Targeting | JTBD/Needs | KBFs |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Man | TBD | TBD |
| Woman | TBD | TBD |

### 3. Derive KSFs

Let's derive KSFs from 5F analysis result and KBFs. Note that KSFs must
be derived independently from your business circumstances.

## Design a New Business

If you don't have any basic idea yet, refer to
[idea_creation.md](./idea_creation.md).

Let's see the concrete example of the steps to design a new business.

| **Step** | **Category** | **Purpose** | **Reason/Why It Matters** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **1. Persona Development** | Customer Understanding | Define target customers clearly | Helps focus on specific segments, needs, and behavior patterns |
| **2. JTBD: Jobs to Be Done** | Customer Understanding | Understand the deeper "why" behind customer behavior | Reveals unmet needs and emotional drivers behind purchasing decisions |
| **3. Target Customer Prioritization** | Customer Understanding | Define target customers based on three factors: market size, average customer spend, and ease of access | Enables prioritization of customer segments and identification of the targets where resources can be most effectively invested |
| **4. Customer Journey Mapping** | Customer Understanding | Visualize the full experience from the customer’s perspective | Identifies pain points, opportunities, and key touchpoints for value delivery |
| **5. 3C Analysis (Company, Customer, Competitor)** | Market & Environment Analysis | Evaluate internal capabilities, customer needs, and market position | Helps determine where you can win and how to differentiate |
| **6. PEST Analysis** | Market & Environment Analysis | Understand macro-environmental forces (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) | Identifies external trends that may affect market dynamics or opportunities |
| **7. SWOT Analysis** | Market & Environment Analysis | Map internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats | Enables strategic alignment and risk assessment |
| **8. Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)** | Value Design | Match customer jobs, pains, and gains with your offering | Ensures the product/service solves real, valuable problems for the customer |
| **9. Business Model Canvas (BMC)** | Value Design | Visualize how your business creates, delivers, and captures value | Aligns value proposition with channels, partners, revenue streams, etc |
| **10. [Working Backwards (Press Release + FAQ)](./the_amazon_working_backwards_method.md)** | Value Design | Clarify the customer outcome and reverse-engineer the solution | Forces you to validate desirability and clarity before building anything |
| **11. MVP Design** | Hypothesis Testing & Execution | Build a minimal version to test your assumptions | Helps reduce risk and validate product-market fit early on |
| **12. Lean Canvas** | Hypothesis Testing & Execution | Simplify the business model for rapid experimentation | Ideal for startups or innovation teams needing fast iteration |
| **13. Startup Fit Journey** | Strategy Evaluation & Optimization | Ensure internal alignment and external market fit | Bridges the gap between what you've built (MVP) and how it fits into the broader market and your business strategy. It's about achieving consistency across your value proposition, business model, and strategic goals. |
| **14. TOWS Matrix** | Strategy Evaluation & Optimization | Convert SWOT insights into actionable strategies | Bridges the gap between analysis and concrete decisions |
| **15. Advantage Matrix** | Strategy Evaluation & Optimization | Categorize business units based on type and sustainability of competitive advantage | Helps determine investment priority and strategic posture |
