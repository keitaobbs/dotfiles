# Business Framework

## Derive KBFs/KSFs

KSFs are the critical elements a business must excel at to succeed in a
given industry or market.

### 1. Conduct Five Forces Analysis

You can understand the competitive dynamics and pressure points in the
industry with 5F analysis. It helps determine the external factors that
will influence success; forms the foundation for strategic alignment.

```
                     +-----------+
                     | Threat of |
                     | New Entry |
                     +-----------+
                           |
                           v
+----------+    +----------------------+    +-------+
| Supplier | -> |    Rivalry among     | <- | Buyer |
|  Power   |    | Existing Competitors |    | Power |
+----------+    +----------------------+    +-------+
                           ^
                           |
                    +--------------+
                    | Threat of    |
                    | Substitution |
                    +--------------+
```

### 2. Identify KBFs

KBFs are the critical elements that influence a customer's decision to
purchase a product or service.

| Segmentation/Targeting | JTBD/Needs | KBFs |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Man | TBD | TBD |
| Woman | TBD | TBD |

### 3. Derive KSFs

Let's derive KSFs from 5F analysis result and KBFs. Note that KSFs must
be derived independently from your business circumstances.

## Design a New Business

If you don't have any basic idea yet, refer to
[idea_creation.md](./idea_creation.md).

Let's see the concrete example of the steps to design a new business.

| **Step** | **Category** | **Purpose** | **Reason/Why It Matters** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **1. Persona Development** | Customer Understanding | Define target customers clearly | Helps focus on specific segments, needs, and behavior patterns |
| **2. JTBD: Jobs to Be Done** | Customer Understanding | Understand the deeper "why" behind customer behavior | Reveals unmet needs and emotional drivers behind purchasing decisions |
| **3. Customer Journey Mapping** | Customer Understanding | Visualize the full experience from the customerâ€™s perspective | Identifies pain points, opportunities, and key touchpoints for value delivery |
| **4. 3C Analysis (Company, Customer, Competitor)** | Market & Environment Analysis | Evaluate internal capabilities, customer needs, and market position | Helps determine where you can win and how to differentiate |
| **5. PEST Analysis** | Market & Environment Analysis | Understand macro-environmental forces (Political, Economic, Social, Technological) | Identifies external trends that may affect market dynamics or opportunities |
| **6. SWOT Analysis** | Market & Environment Analysis | Map internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats | Enables strategic alignment and risk assessment |
| **7. Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)** | Value Design | Match customer jobs, pains, and gains with your offering | Ensures the product/service solves real, valuable problems for the customer |
| **8. Business Model Canvas (BMC)** | Value Design | Visualize how your business creates, delivers, and captures value | Aligns value proposition with channels, partners, revenue streams, etc |
| **9. [Working Backwards (Press Release + FAQ)](./the_amazon_working_backwards_method.md)** | Value Design | Clarify the customer outcome and reverse-engineer the solution | Forces you to validate desirability and clarity before building anything |
| **10. MVP Design** | Hypothesis Testing & Execution | Build a minimal version to test your assumptions | Helps reduce risk and validate product-market fit early on |
| **11. Lean Canvas** | Hypothesis Testing & Execution | Simplify the business model for rapid experimentation | Ideal for startups or innovation teams needing fast iteration |
| **12. TOWS Matrix** | Strategy Evaluation & Optimization | Convert SWOT insights into actionable strategies | Bridges the gap between analysis and concrete decisions |
| **13. Advantage Matrix** | Strategy Evaluation & Optimization | Categorize business units based on type and sustainability of competitive advantage | Helps determine investment priority and strategic posture |
